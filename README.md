## Features

- Next.js 13 App Directory
- Radix UI Primitives
- Tailwind CSS
- Icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) very cool! 
- Dark mode 
- Server side rendering
- using react pending form! interesting stuff.

## stuff to work on in order of priority
- [ ] pending status /loader on the is complete - hmm can get the server to show this and experimental formstatus?
- [ ] delete - needs to disable and switch to loading
- [x] table 
- [ ] sorting again server side sorting would also need pending / loader
